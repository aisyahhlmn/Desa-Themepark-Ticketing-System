    "Theme Park is one of most attractive places to be visited especially during the school holiday in Malaysia. Desa Park is a theme park that will open early next year in Selangor. Desa Park offers many water activities, indoor games and rides in which all of them are all scattered in different locations in the park. In addition, the ticket fee is charged at each activity, games or rides chooses by visitors.\n",
    "To streamline the Desa Park management and operation process, JustCode Software House has been appointed to provide an application that support the ticket purchasing process and information of the theme park. As a programmer at JustCode Software House, you need to develop an application that has the following functionalities so that the visitors can planned their activities well. The functionalities are:\n",
    "i.\tStore the information of ticket fee for each activity, games or ride using linked list and calculate the total payment for tickets \n",
    "ii.\tCalculate the distance travelled by a visitor using graph. Visitors need to mention the sequence of locations to be visited in the theme park. \n",
    "\n",
    "Task:\n",
    "1.\tProvide overview and objective of your application development.\n",
    "2.\tDraw a visual map of theme park with locations of activities and distances among all the locations using graph. \n",
    "3.\tProduce adjacency matrix and adjacency list that represents locations and distances for a graph in Task 1.\n",
    "4.\tDevelop an application that fulfill the requirements below:\n",
    "a)\tImplement linked list to calculate the tickets fee and display the fee for each location and total ticket fee. \n",
    "b)\tImplement graph that represent locations (vertices) and distances (edges) that map your design in Task 1 and Task 2. \n",
    "5.\tApply good programming practices in terms of:\n",
    "a)\tFlow of the system (appropriate menu)\n",
    "b)\tComments\n",
    "c)\tOutput layout\n",
    "6.\tInclude print screen of the output and the coding of your application in your report.\n"
