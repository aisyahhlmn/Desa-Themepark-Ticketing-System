# Desa-Themepark-Ticketing-System

Desa Park, a new theme park in Selangor, Malaysia, that offers various water activities, indoor games, and rides. Visitors are charged a ticket fee for each activity, game or ride for customer to choose.

To streamline the Desa Park management and operation process, I need to provide an application that support the ticket purchasing process and information of the theme park. I need to develop an application that has the following functionalities so that the visitors can planned their activities well. The functionalities are:
i.Store the information of ticket fee for each activity, games or ride using linked list and calculate the total payment for tickets 
ii.	Calculate the distance travelled by a visitor using graph. Visitors need to mention the sequence of locations to be visited in the theme park.
